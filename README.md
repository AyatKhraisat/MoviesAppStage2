# Movies App 
## What's is Movie App?
This Project is part of [Udacity](https://www.udacity.com/) Android developer Nanodegree
Most of us can relate to kicking back on the couch and enjoying a movie with friends and family.
In this project, I built an app to allow users to discover the most popular Top rated

## key features
-	Present the user with a grid arrangement of movie posters upon launch.
-	Allow  user to change sort order via a setting:
-	The sort order can be by most popular or by highest-rated
- Allow the user to tap on a movie poster and transition to a details screen with additional information such as:
	original title
  
	movie poster image thumbnail
  
	A plot synopsis (called overview in the api)
  
	user rating (called vote_average in the api)
  
  release date
  
-	fetch data from the Internet with theMovieDB API.
- use adapters and custom list layouts to populate list views.
-	incorporate libraries to simplify the amount of code like picasso.
